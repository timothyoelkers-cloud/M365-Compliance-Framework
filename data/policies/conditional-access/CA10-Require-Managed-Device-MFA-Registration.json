Ensure Intune device compliance policies and device enrollment are configured before enforcing. For initial MFA registration bootstrapping, consider using Temporary Access Pass (TAP) on compliant devices. Deploy in report-only first. Replace  with the Object ID of your break-glass exclusion security group."
