This email BYPASSES all Exchange Online Protection scanning including anti-spam, anti-malware, Safe Attachments, Safe Links, and DLP policies. This creates a significant security gap where malicious content can reach users without any inspection. Setting AllowEmailIntoChannel to false removes this capability."
